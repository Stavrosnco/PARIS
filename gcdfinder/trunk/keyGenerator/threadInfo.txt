With computer being used to play cached music (represented ~2% cpu) and with
FFox open (this was the only significant load). and Top for CPU usage

Generating 1000 Keys
Q length = 15

In Real Seconds
1 Thread    -  ~100% Load  57.5s
2 Threads   -  ~160% load  44.6s 
3 Threads   -  ~200% Load  45.7s

4 Threads   -  ~210% Load  46.7s

30 Threads  -  ~190% Load  50.34s

it does not seem like the Q is blocking, it seems like key generation is still
the bottleneck


Q length = 500
